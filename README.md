## Description
In this assignment, we are supposed to remove div and replace tags with semantic tags. We are supposed to add comments to the html code. I changed the website title to view properly in the browser. I updated body with semantic header elements. Added article and article 2 tags to body sections to better seperate code to make it easier to read.
